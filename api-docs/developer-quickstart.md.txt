# Developer Quickstart
A developer quickstart guide must be a concise, action-oriented document designed to get a new developer from "zero" to their first successful API call in under 5 minutes [user query]. This guide will strictly follow the principles of a how-to guide from the Di√°taxis framework, which focuses on providing a problem-solution sequence with no digression or unnecessary explanation.

The guide will begin with a concise list of prerequisites, such as having cURL or a code editor installed. Each subsequent step will be a clear command or instruction, providing immediate, visible results. For example, after an authentication step, the guide will show what a successful response should look like, building user confidence and confirming they are on the right path. Inline, working code blocks for cURL commands will be provided to ensure the examples are both practical and accurate.

### Quickstart Guide: Get Your First Transaction History
This guide gets you from zero to a successful API call in under five minutes.

Prerequisites
A terminal or command prompt.

cURL installed.

An API Key. If you don't have one, please refer to the Qbank Connect API Conceptual Guide for instructions on how to request one.

Step 1: Get Your API Key
You must have a valid API Key to make calls to the Qbank Connect API. Once you have received your key, save it to a variable to make subsequent commands easier.bash
export QBANK_API_KEY="qb-1a2b3c4d..."

The response should look like the following:

<<INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE: A screenshot of a terminal showing the successful cURL command and the JSON response from the previous step. The output should be clean, readable, and clearly show the accountId.>>

Step 3: Retrieve Transaction History
Now that you have the accountId, let's retrieve the transaction history for that account.

Your terminal should show a list of recent transactions.
<>

You Did It!
You've successfully made your first two calls to the Qbank Connect API.

Your API key will be a long string of letters and numbers.

Step 2: Retrieve a Customer's Account ID
We'll start by looking up a customer to get their account information. We'll use a sample CIF (Customer Information File) number.

The response should look like the following:

<<INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE: A screenshot of a terminal showing the successful cURL command and the JSON response from the previous step. The output should be clean, readable, and clearly show the accountId.>>

Step 3: Retrieve Transaction History
Now that you have the accountId, let's retrieve the transaction history for that account.

Your terminal should show a list of recent transactions.

You Did It!
You've successfully made your first two calls to the Qbank Connect API.
