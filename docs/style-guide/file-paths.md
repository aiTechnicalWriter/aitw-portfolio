## File Paths

Always enclose file paths in backticks to distinguish them from surrounding text. This improves readability and ensures that paths are treated as literal values.

âœ… Examples:

- Configuration is stored in `C:\QBank\Config\settings.yml`.  
- Markdown files are located in `docs/user-guide/`.  
- To update the homepage, edit `docs/index.md`.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Avoid using quotation marks or italics for file paths. Backticks preserve formatting and prevent ambiguity.
