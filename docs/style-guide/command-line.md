## Command Line Instructions

Use fenced code blocks with triple backticks to display terminal commands. Always specify the language as `bash` for shell commands to enable syntax highlighting.

âœ… Example:

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```

ðŸ’¡ Tips:

- Do **not** include shell prompts like `$` or `PS>` unless needed for clarity.  
- Keep commands short and focused. If multiple steps are required, use numbered lists or separate blocks.  
- Use comments sparingly to explain logic or flags, especially in scripts.

ðŸ§  Best Practice: Always test commands before publishing to ensure they work as expected in the target environment.
