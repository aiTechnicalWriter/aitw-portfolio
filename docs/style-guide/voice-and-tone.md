## Voice & Tone Guidelines

Your documentation should reflect a voice that is clear, confident, and helpful. Tone may shift depending on context, but it should always align with the following principles:

### Voice Characteristics

- âœ… **Professional but approachable**: Avoid jargon, but donâ€™t oversimplify.  
- âœ… **Confident but not arrogant**: Provide guidance with clarity, not condescension.  
- âœ… **Helpful and empathetic**: Anticipate user needs and frustrations.  
- âœ… **Concise and purposeful**: Every word should serve the reader.

### Tone Adjustments by Context

| Context | Tone |
|--------|------|
| Error messages | Calm, reassuring, solution-oriented |
| Onboarding | Friendly, encouraging, motivational |
| Reference docs | Neutral, precise, minimal |
| Troubleshooting | Supportive, direct, confidence-building |

ðŸ’¡ Tip: When in doubt, write like a thoughtful teammateâ€”not a robot, not a marketer, and definitely not a gatekeeper.
