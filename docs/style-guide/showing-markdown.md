## Showing Markdown Syntax in Markdown

To display Markdown syntax itselfâ€”such as triple backticks or fenced code blocksâ€”without rendering them, wrap the syntax inside a higher-level code block using four or more backticks.

âœ… Example:

````markdown
````markdown
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
````

This renders as:

```
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```


ðŸ’¡ Tip: Always use more backticks outside than inside. If your inner block uses three, wrap it in four. If your inner block uses four, wrap it in five. This ensures proper escaping and clean rendering.
