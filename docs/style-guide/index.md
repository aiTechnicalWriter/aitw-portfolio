# Style Guide Overview

This section defines standards and reusable components for writing clear, consistent, and user-friendly documentation across platforms.

## Purpose

The style guide helps unify voice, terminology, and structure across UI, API, CLI, and support content. It supports modular reuse and onboarding for writers and developers.

## Structure

The guide is organized into modular topics and includes:

- **Voice & Tone Guidelines**: Define personality, empathy, and clarity.
- **UI Terminology Standards**: Shared terms and naming conventions.
- **Error Messaging Guidelines**: Principles, patterns, and platform notes.
- **Code & Syntax Guide**: Formatting and language-specific conventions.
- **Content Types**: Structural templates for tutorials, references, and how-tos.
- **Includes folder**: Reusable fragments for error patterns, terminology, and principles.

> Tip: Use `!include` syntax to embed reusable fragments and reduce duplication.
