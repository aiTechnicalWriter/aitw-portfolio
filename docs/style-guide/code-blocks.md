## Code Blocks

Use fenced code blocks with triple backticks (` ``` `) to display multi-line code. Always specify the language for syntax highlighting.

````markdown
```python
def calculate_balance(transactions):
    return sum(transactions)
```
````
This renders as:

```python
def calculate_balance(transactions):
    return sum(transactions)
```
