## Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to ensure clarity, consistency, and professionalism in all code-related documentation:

âœ… General Rules:

- Keep code examples short and focused.  
- Use comments in code to explain logic when necessary.  
- Avoid wrapping code in quotation marksâ€”use backticks instead.  
- Ensure all code is tested and accurate before publishing.  
- Use consistent indentation and spacing in all code samples.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: When documenting complex workflows, break them into smaller, reusable code blocks and explain each step clearly. This improves readability and supports modular reuse.
