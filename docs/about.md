# About This Project

This Docs-as-Code portfolio was created to demonstrate modular, maintainable documentation practices using MkDocs, the Diátaxis framework, and real-world technical writing strategies.

### Goals
- Showcase structured authoring with reusable Markdown includes
- Align content to user needs through Diátaxis: Tutorials, How-To Guides, Explanations, and References
- Integrate interactive API documentation via OpenAPI and Swagger UI
- Reflect best practices in error messaging, UI terminology, and content strategy

### Technologies Used
- **MkDocs** with Material theme
- **mkdocs-macros-plugin** for dynamic includes
- **Swagger UI plugin** for OpenAPI rendering
- **Custom macros** for modular content reuse

### Fictional Context
The documentation simulates a financial platform called **QBank**, featuring:
- **NexusGateway API** for modern and legacy service integration
- **InsightEngine AI** for fraud detection
- **C4 Model** for architectural clarity

This project is a sandbox for exploring Docs-as-Code workflows, modular content design, and the future of technical communication.
