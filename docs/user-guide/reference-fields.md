Reference: Qbank Core Field Definitions
This section is a factual list of all fields and their definitions within the application's UI, intended for quick look-up.

Field Name	Type	Description
CIF	string	The unique Customer Information File number. Used for all customer identification.
Amount	float	The monetary value of the transaction. Always uses two decimal places.
Status	enum	The current state of the transaction. Can be PENDING, POSTED, or REVERSED.

A video script with annotations will also be included, demonstrating expertise in multi-modal documentation [user query]. The script will explain a complex Qbank Core process (e.g., handling a customer dispute). The annotations will show where visuals (B-roll, screen capture) and graphics will be placed, demonstrating a sophisticated approach to communication beyond text alone.
