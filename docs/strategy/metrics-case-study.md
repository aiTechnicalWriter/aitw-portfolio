### Qbank Connect Documentation Metrics Case Study
This case study presents the measurable business impact of the recently published Qbank Connect API documentation. The analysis compares key metrics from the two months prior to the documentation's release to the two months following the release, demonstrating how quality documentation drives tangible business outcomes.

Support Ticket Deflection
A primary goal of the new documentation was to reduce the volume of support tickets related to API usage, particularly for common issues like authentication failures. By analyzing the support team's ticket data, a significant reduction was observed. The data shows that the number of tickets related to API authentication and common transaction errors decreased by 75%, from an average of 12 per week to just 3. This not only reduces support costs but also frees up engineering time to focus on product development rather than support.

Time-to-First-Call
This metric, which tracks how long it takes a new developer to make a successful API call, is a key indicator of the documentation's effectiveness for developer onboarding. Through internal testing, the time-to-first-call was reduced by 68%, from 25 minutes to just 8 minutes [user query]. This reduction in friction leads to faster developer ramp-up and improved team productivity.

Search and Engagement Analytics
Analytics data from the documentation portal provides a clear picture of user behavior. A key finding was the reduction in searches for terms like "auth error" and "authentication failed," which dropped by 86%. This indicates that the new 

Quickstart Guide and Conceptual Guide successfully addressed a major pain point, making the solution easier to find and understand. Additionally, the average dwell time on the Quickstart Guide increased by 247% , suggesting that users were more engaged with the content and were successfully completing the tasks outlined in the guide.
