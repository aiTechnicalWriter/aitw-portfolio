# Welcome to the QBank Docs-as-Code Portfolio

This site showcases elements of a documentation system built for QBank â€” a fictional financial platform designed to demonstrate best practices in technical writing and developer experience.

Explore how we use:
- **MkDocs + Macros** for scalable reuse
- **Modular Includes** for maintainable, multi-domain documentation
- **OpenAPI + Swagger UI** for interactive API reference

Whether you're a developer, designer, or documentation strategist, this portfolio offers a blueprint for building clear, maintainable, and user-centered docs.
