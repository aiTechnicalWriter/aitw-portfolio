# QBank Connect API Guide

This guide introduces the core concepts behind the QBank Connect API design, including authentication, data formats, rate limits, and error handling. It’s intended for developers integrating with our platform and technical writers documenting API behavior.

## Overview

## Authentication

QBank Connect API uses token-based authentication. Developers must first create an account and obtain credentials, which are exchanged for a bearer token via the `/auth/token` endpoint. Tokens expire after 30 minutes and must be refreshed.

## Data Formats

All requests and responses use JSON. Field names follow camelCase conventions. Dates are formatted as ISO 8601 strings. Binary payloads (e.g., images or documents) must be base64-encoded.

## Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage, the API enforces rate limits per account. Standard accounts are limited to 100 requests per minute. Exceeding this threshold returns a `429 Too Many Requests` error with a `Retry-After` header.

## Error Handling

Errors follow a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_FIELD",
    "message": "The 'amount' field must be a positive number."
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use exponential backoff when retrying failed requests
- Always validate input before sending API calls
- Log both request and response payloads for auditability
- Avoid hardcoding tokens — use secure storage and refresh logic
