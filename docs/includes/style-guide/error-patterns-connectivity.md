## Connectivity Error Patterns

Use these patterns when users experience network or server interruptions. Focus on recovery and reassurance.

```text
Connection lost. Please check your internet and try again.
```

```text
Server timeout. Try again later or contact support if the issue persists.
```

```text
Unable to reach the server. Working offline until connection is restored.
```

### Best Practices

- Avoid blaming the user or their device.
- Suggest retry actions or fallback options.
- Keep messages short and non-technical.
