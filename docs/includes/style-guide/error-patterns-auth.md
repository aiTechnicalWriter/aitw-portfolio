## Authentication & Authorization Error Patterns

Use these patterns when users encounter login issues or access restrictions. Keep messages secure and user-friendly.

```text
Access denied. You don’t have permission to view this page.
```

```text
Session expired. Please sign in again.
```

```text
Invalid credentials. Please check your username and password.
```

### Best Practices

- Avoid exposing internal roles, permissions, or security details.
- Offer next steps when possible (e.g., “Contact your administrator”).
- Don’t reveal whether a username or password is correct—keep responses generic to prevent enumeration.
