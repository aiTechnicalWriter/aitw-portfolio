## Platform-Specific Notes

Adjust terminology based on the user’s environment to match platform conventions and expectations.

### Web

- Use **Click** for buttons and links.
- Use **Select** for dropdowns and radio buttons.

### Mobile

- Use **Tap** instead of Click.
- Use **Swipe**, **Pinch**, or **Drag** for gestures.

### CLI (Command Line Interface)

- Use **Type** or **Run** for commands.
- Avoid UI metaphors like “Click” or “Select.”

### Desktop Apps

- Use **Click**, **Double-click**, and **Right-click** as needed.
- Match terminology to OS conventions (e.g., “Preferences” vs “Settings”).

### Notes

- Be consistent within each platform.
- Avoid mixing metaphors (e.g., “Tap the Save button” in a desktop app).
