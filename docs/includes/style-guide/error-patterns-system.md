## System Failure Error Patterns

Use these patterns when something breaks unexpectedly and no specific cause is available. Keep messages calm and constructive.

```text
Something went wrong. Please refresh the page or try again later.
```

```text
Unexpected error occurred. We’re working to fix it.
```

```text
The operation couldn’t be completed. Try again in a few minutes.
```

### Best Practices

- Use generic fallback messages only when no actionable detail is available.
- Avoid technical codes unless the audience is developers.
- Consider logging the error for internal diagnostics and support follow-up.
