## Validation Error Patterns

Use these patterns when guiding users to correct input errors. Keep messages close to the field and avoid technical jargon.

```text
[Field name] is required. Please enter a value.
```

```text
Enter a valid email address.
```

```text
Password must be at least 8 characters.
```

### Best Practices

- Be specific about what’s wrong and how to fix it.
- Avoid vague phrases like “Invalid input.”
- Use plain language and field-specific feedback.
