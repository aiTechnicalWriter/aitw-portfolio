## Reuse Strategy

Use these guidelines to modularize and reuse UI terminology across documentation and interface copy.

- **Includes**: Break terminology into platform-specific includes for web, mobile, CLI, and desktop.
- **Glossary Integration**: Link key terms to glossary entries for deeper context and definitions.
- **Cross-Topic Consistency**: Reuse terminology in error messages, onboarding flows, and help content.
- **Component-Level Reuse**: Apply consistent phrasing in UI components like buttons, dialogs, and tooltips.
- **Review Workflow**: Establish a review process to catch inconsistencies before publishing.

### Example

```markdown
!include "includes/ui-terminology-standard-terms.md"
```

This ensures consistent phrasing across multiple topics without duplication.
