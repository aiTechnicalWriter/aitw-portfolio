The API lifecycle begins with onboarding, where developers receive credentials and access documentation. During this phase, initial integration and sandbox testing are encouraged.

Once live, the API enters the active phase, where stability, performance, and support are prioritized. Updates may be introduced, but backward compatibility is maintained.

Eventually, APIs may be deprecated or sunset. Clear communication, migration paths, and extended support windows help ensure a smooth transition.
