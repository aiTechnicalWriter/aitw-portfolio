The API lifecycle consists of three primary stages:

1. **Onboarding**  
   Developers receive credentials, access documentation, and begin sandbox testing. Support is focused on setup and integration.

2. **Active Use**  
   The API is live in production. Monitoring, performance tuning, and versioning are key concerns. Support shifts to uptime and reliability.

3. **Deprecation & Sunset**  
   APIs may be phased out with advance notice. Developers are guided through migration paths, and legacy support is offered during the transition.
