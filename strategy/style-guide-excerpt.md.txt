Qbank Documentation Style Guide (Excerpt)
This document provides standards for creating clear, consistent, and helpful documentation for Qbank products.

Voice and Tone
Our voice is who we are; our tone is how we express it in different situations.

Our Voice: Confident, knowledgeable, and reliable.

We are experts in our field, but we are not arrogant. We write with clarity and precision, reflecting the trust our customers place in us.

Our Tone: Helpful and direct.

The tone should adapt to the context of the document.

In tutorials and how-to guides: Be encouraging and straightforward. Use the second person ("you") to speak directly to the reader. Guide them through the process as a helpful partner.

Example: "You can get your API keys from the developer portal."

In reference and architectural documents: Be more formal and descriptive. Focus on accuracy and objective explanation.

Example: "The service authenticates requests using a bearer token."

In error messages and troubleshooting guides: Be empathetic and solution-oriented. Acknowledge the user's frustration and guide them directly to a solution. Avoid blaming the user.

Good: "Couldn't connect to the database. Check if the database is running and the connection string is correct."

Bad: "You entered the wrong database credentials."

Documenting Error Messages
Well-documented error messages are critical for a good developer experience. Every error message should answer three questions:

What happened? (The problem)

Why did it happen? (The cause)

What can I do about it? (The solution)

Format for API Error Responses
All NexusGateway API errors must be documented in the OpenAPI specification using a standardized Error schema.

Example Error (401 Unauthorized):

Message: "Authentication token is missing or invalid."

Cause: The request was made without a valid Authorization header containing a bearer token, or the provided token has expired or is malformed.

Solution:

Ensure you are including the Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN> header in your request.

If the token has expired, request a new one from the /oauth/token endpoint.

Verify that you are copying the entire token string.
